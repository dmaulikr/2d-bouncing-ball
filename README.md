# 2d-bouncing-ball
This is unity project containing basic functionality of physic materials and default behavior.
Script is written in C# to map horizontal inputs to the ball players all together.
Gravity is applied to the ball so if inputs are been forced ball can fall off too!!
If person doesn't require input from user and wants automatic behavior then he just needs to remove c# script attached to the ball That's it!!
I have choose different weight, height and angels for all balls.
All balls are obstacle for each other and also have obstacle like cubes while falling onto the floor and by default makes pattern.
